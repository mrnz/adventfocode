## Description

Here are my solutions to problems from [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com). Script are written in JavaScript and run in Node.js. All scripts are covered by tests written in Mocha testing framework. Report is created by Istambul code coverage tool ( *See [details](https://codecov.io/gh/mrnz/adventofcode)* ). Merry Christmas! 


## Installation

First clone the repository to your local disk:

```git clone https://github.com/mrnz/adventofcode.git```

Once the repository has been cloned, you may install this all dependency with this command:

``` npm install ```

## Run sctipts

You can run individual script  

``` npm run dX ```

where X is accordingly a number from **1** to **25** or run all script at once (*warning: it can take more then one minute*) with command: 

``` npm start ```

## Test scripts

Each script is covered by tests run using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). You can either see all results by clicking **build badge** on top of this page or perform all tests localy with command:

``` npm test ```

## Enjoy !
